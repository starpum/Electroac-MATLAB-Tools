# Electroac-MATLAB-Tools
Some tools I've coded in MATLAB for electroacoustics / acoustic DSP


Hi stranger! Thanks for checking out this repo. 
I'm working on a few MATLAB tools for electro-acoustics and will publish them here while I'm working. 


Simulation_Driver_Auralization (in progress) : a simple MATLAB tool to run and auralise driver in different setups (working : closed and vented boxes; TODO : baffle and passive radiator systems). Allows to check the impedance, volume velocity, and radiated pressure at a distance selected by the user. 
In progress : auralization of the system, thanks to a user-selected music/signal
