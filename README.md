# Electroac-MATLAB-Tools
Some tools I've coded in MATLAB for electroacoustics / acoustic DSP


Hi stranger! Thanks for checking out this repo. 
I'm working on a few MATLAB tools for electro-acoustics and will publish them here while I'm working. 
All of these tools are open-source, as I thrive for an open, easy access to knowloedge worlwide.
